# {{WORKFLOW_NAME}}

## Project Structure

```
{{STRUCTURE_TREE}}
```
<!-- Complete directory tree showing every file in the project.
     Use standard tree notation (├──, └──, │).
     Include brief comments after filenames for clarity.
     Standard directories live inside agent/:
     agent/Prompts/ (with NN_Agent_Name.md files),
     agent/scripts/ (with src/, tests/, requirements.txt, README.md),
     agent/utils/ (with code/, docs/). -->

## How to Use

Start the full workflow:
```
/{{START_COMMAND}}
```

Or run individual steps:
```
{{COMMAND_LIST_WITH_DESCRIPTIONS}}
```
<!-- List each slash command with a comment describing what it does.
     Example: /gather-requirements    # Step 1: Interview the user -->

## Key Rules

{{RULES_LIST}}
<!-- Project-specific rules. Include:
     - What to read before starting (always agentic.md)
     - What NOT to skip (approval gates)
     - Where outputs go
     - What every output must include
     - Any constraints (no external deps, no code execution, etc.)
     - If scripts/ exist: "Scripts require a Python venv: `python3 -m venv agent/scripts/.venv && source agent/scripts/.venv/bin/activate && pip install -r agent/scripts/requirements.txt`" -->

## Naming Conventions

{{NAMING_CONVENTIONS}}
<!-- Document the naming patterns used in this project:
     - Slash commands: kebab-case
     - Agent prompts: zero-padded with underscores (e.g., 01_Agent_Name.md)
     - Output folders: kebab-case or date-based
     - Placeholders: {{UPPER_SNAKE_CASE}} -->
