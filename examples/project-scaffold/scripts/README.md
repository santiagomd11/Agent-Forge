# Scripts

Scripts that support the project scaffolding workflow.

## Structure

- `src/` - Source scripts
- `tests/` - Test scripts

## Setup

Create and activate a Python virtual environment before running any scripts:

```bash
python3 -m venv scripts/.venv
source scripts/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run this from the project root (`project-scaffold/`). The venv lives inside `scripts/.venv` to keep it co-located.

## Usage

All scripts in `src/` should be run with the venv active:

```bash
source scripts/.venv/bin/activate
python scripts/src/your_script.py
```

## Tests

```bash
source scripts/.venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/
```
