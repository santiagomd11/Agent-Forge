## Step 1: Gather Requirements

**Purpose:** Understand what the user wants to automate and what good output looks like.

**Ask for the description first. Wait for the response before continuing.**

Question 1:
```
Describe the workflow you want to build. What should it accomplish?
```

**After receiving the description:**

Analyze the description. Try to infer: the major phases of work, what inputs the workflow takes, what outputs it produces, whether desktop interaction is needed, and who will use it. If the description gives you enough to infer all of this, proceed directly to compiling the requirements summary without asking further questions.

If the description is ambiguous about the process (you cannot tell what the major steps are or how the work flows), ask one follow-up:

```
Can you describe the main steps or phases of the work? What does someone
currently do manually that this workflow should handle?
```

Only ask this if you genuinely cannot infer the process from the description. Do not ask it as a formality.

**Optionally accept quality samples:**

If the user wants to provide examples of what good output looks like, accept them. Each sample may include an optional short label describing what it shows. Quality samples are not required. If the user does not offer them, do not ask.

**Conventions (not questions):**

- Output location is always `output/{kebab-case-name}/`. Do not ask.
- Computer use is a flag. If the description mentions desktop interaction (opening apps, clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating GUIs, automating tasks that require seeing the screen), set computer_use to true. Otherwise default to false. Do not ask.
- Approval gates, user type, and output structure are determined in Step 2. Do not ask.

**Compile a requirements summary containing:**

1. **Name.** A kebab-case name inferred from the description.
2. **Purpose.** 2-3 sentences describing what the workflow accomplishes.
3. **Steps (inferred).** The major phases of work as you understand them. Mark as "inferred" if not stated explicitly.
4. **Inputs.** What the user provides to start the workflow.
5. **Outputs.** Files, folders, or artifacts the workflow produces.
6. **Computer use.** true or false, with the reason.
7. **Quality samples.** Any provided examples (or "none").
8. **Output location.** `output/{name}/`

Present the summary to the user for confirmation.

**Save:** Hold requirements summary in context for subsequent steps.

---

## Step 2: Design Architecture ⏸

**Read:** `forge/Prompts/02_Workflow_Architect.md`

Using the gathered requirements, design the workflow architecture:

1. Determine the number of steps (5-9)
2. Identify which steps need approval gates ⏸
3. Identify which steps need quality loops (evaluate-iterate pattern)
4. Determine how many specialized agents are needed and their roles
5. Design the output folder structure
6. Decide which patterns from `forge/patterns/` apply
7. Identify scripts the workflow needs. For each script, specify:
   - Name (e.g., `fetch_data.py`, `gen_html.py`)
   - Type: **format** (document/file generation) or **general** (API client, validator, scraper, etc.)
   - Purpose (1-2 sentences)
   - Dependencies (pip packages)
   If the workflow does not need scripts, state "Scripts: none".

**Read relevant patterns from `forge/patterns/` based on the requirements.** For example:
- If the workflow needs human review: read `forge/patterns/03-approval-gates.md`
- If the workflow needs iterative quality: read `forge/patterns/04-quality-loops.md`
- If each execution needs a fresh copy: read `forge/patterns/07-template-scaffold.md`
- If the workflow needs desktop interaction: read `forge/patterns/10-computer-use.md`

**Present the architecture to the user:**

```
Proposed Workflow Architecture:

Name: {workflow-name}
Steps: {N}

1. {Step Name}, {description}
2. {Step Name}, {description} ⏸
...

Agents Needed:
- {Agent 1 Name}: {role description}
- {Agent 2 Name}: {role description}

Scripts Needed:
- {script_name.py} (format|general): {purpose} [deps: {packages}]
- (or "none")

Output Structure:
{folder tree}

Patterns Applied:
- {Pattern name}: {why}
```

**Wait for user approval. If changes requested, iterate.**

---

## Step 3: Generate Orchestrator ⏸

**Read:** `forge/utils/scaffold/agentic.md.template`
**Read:** `forge/Prompts/03_Prompt_Writer.md`

Generate the workflow's `agentic.md` using the template as structural guide:

1. Fill in the workflow name and trigger commands
2. Create the workflow overview diagram
3. Write each step with:
   - Purpose description
   - Which agent prompt to read (if applicable)
   - Numbered workflow actions
   - What to save
   - Approval gate marker ⏸ (if applicable)
4. Add the "After Each Step" approval protocol
5. Add the output structure diagram
6. Add the quality checks table

**Present the complete agentic.md to the user for review.**
**Wait for approval. If changes requested, iterate.**

**Save:** `output/{workflow-name}/agentic.md`

---

## Step 4: Generate Specialized Agents

**Read:** `forge/Prompts/03_Prompt_Writer.md`
**Read:** `forge/utils/scaffold/agent-prompt.md.template`

Optionally, read the **Senior Prompt Engineer** prompt at `forge/Prompts/01_Senior_Prompt_Engineer.md` for complex or domain-specific prompts that require deeper expertise. The Prompt Writer prompt covers the structural template; the Senior Prompt Engineer covers the craft of writing high-quality, production-grade prompts.

For each agent identified in Step 2:

1. Generate a comprehensive prompt following the canonical template:
   - Context (role and expertise)
   - Input/Output specifications
   - Quality requirements
   - Rules (Always/Never lists)
   - Actual Input section with placeholders
   - Expected Workflow section
2. Number the prompt files sequentially: `01_{Agent_Name}.md`, `02_{Agent_Name}.md`, etc.
3. If the workflow needs desktop interaction (computer_use flag set in Step 1), generate a `05_Computer_Use_Agent.md` prompt based on `forge/Prompts/05_Computer_Use_Agent.md`. Adapt it to the specific workflow's desktop tasks.

**Save:** `output/{workflow-name}/agent/Prompts/{NN}_{Agent_Name}.md` for each agent

---

## Step 5: Generate CLI Commands

**Read:** `forge/utils/scaffold/command.md.template`

For each step in the designed workflow:

1. Create a `.claude/commands/` file with:
   - YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
   - Instruction to read `agentic.md`
   - Instruction to read the relevant prompt file (if the step uses an agent)
   - Reference to the specific step number and name
   - Brief summary of what the step does (3-5 lines)

2. Additionally create a **master start command** that runs the full workflow from Step 1 through the last step.

3. Copy the fix command from `forge/utils/scaffold/fix.md.template` into the generated workflow's `.claude/commands/fix.md`. This command is standard for all workflows and does not need customization.

4. Copy the fixer agent prompt from `forge/utils/scaffold/00_Workflow_Fixer.md.template` into the generated workflow's `agent/Prompts/00_Workflow_Fixer.md`. This prompt is standard for all workflows and does not need customization.

5. Copy the Senior Prompt Engineer prompt from `forge/utils/scaffold/01_Senior_Prompt_Engineer.md.template` into the generated workflow's `agent/Prompts/01_Senior_Prompt_Engineer.md`. This prompt is used by the fixer when prompt writing or rewriting is needed. It is standard for all workflows and does not need customization.

6. If the workflow uses computer use, also generate execution commands: `execute-workflow.md`, `pause-execution.md`, and `resume-execution.md`. These follow the same command template format but reference the Computer Use Agent instead of a generation step.

**Save:** `output/{workflow-name}/.claude/commands/{command-name}.md` for each command

---

## Step 6: Generate Project Scaffold ⏸

### 6a. Generate project skeleton

Call `generate_scaffold()` from `forge/scripts/src/scaffold.py` to create the project deterministically:

```python
from forge.scripts.src.scaffold import generate_scaffold, ScaffoldConfig

config = ScaffoldConfig(
    workflow_name="{workflow-name}",
    workflow_description="{description from Step 1}",
    folder_name="{workflow-name}",
    steps=[{"number": N, "name": "Step Name", "command": "step-name"}, ...],
    agents=[{"number": N, "name": "Agent_Name"}, ...],
    computer_use=True|False,
)
root = generate_scaffold(config, base_dir="output")
```

This creates the full project structure: README.md, CLAUDE.md, agent/Prompts/, agent/scripts/, agent/utils/, .claude/commands/, output/, and a Python venv at `agent/scripts/.venv/` with export scripts (gen_document.py, gen_xlsx.py) pre-installed.

### 6b. Generate workflow-specific scripts

If scripts were identified in Step 2, generate each one now.

For each **format script** (document/file generation):
1. **Read:** `forge/Prompts/06_Format_Script_Generator.md`
2. Follow the prompt to generate the script code and test code.
3. Place via `add_script()`:

```python
from forge.scripts.src.scaffold import add_script, install_dependencies

add_script(
    agent_root=root,
    script_name="gen_html.py",
    script_content=script_code,
    test_content=test_code,
    dependencies=["jinja2"],
)
install_dependencies(root)
```

For each **general script** (API client, validator, scraper, etc.):
1. **Read:** `forge/Prompts/07_Script_Generator.md`
2. Follow the prompt to generate the script code and test code.
3. Place via `add_script()` and `install_dependencies()` as above.

### 6c. Present and approve

**Present the complete file listing to the user.**
**Wait for approval.**

**Save:** All files are already written by `generate_scaffold()` and `add_script()`.
Confirm the output location: `output/{workflow-name}/`

---

## Step 7: Review and Deliver ⏸

**Read:** `forge/Prompts/04_Quality_Reviewer.md`

Run the quality reviewer's checklist against the generated workflow:

**Self-review checklist:**

- [ ] README.md exists and points to agentic.md
- [ ] agentic.md has all steps with clear instructions
- [ ] Every step in agentic.md has a corresponding slash command in `.claude/commands/`
- [ ] Every agent referenced in agentic.md has a prompt file in `agent/Prompts/`
- [ ] Approval gates are marked at appropriate decision points
- [ ] Output structure is documented in agentic.md
- [ ] CLAUDE.md lists all commands and describes the project structure
- [ ] Agent prompts have all required sections (Context, I/O, Quality, Rules, Actual Input, Expected Workflow)
- [ ] No circular dependencies between steps
- [ ] The workflow is self-contained (no references to files outside its own directory)
- [ ] agent/ directory exists with Prompts/, scripts/, utils/
- [ ] agent/scripts/ contains src/, tests/, requirements.txt, README.md
- [ ] agent/scripts/.venv/ exists and has working pip
- [ ] agent/utils/ contains code/ and docs/
- [ ] agent/scripts/README.md includes venv setup instructions
- [ ] If scripts identified in Step 2: each script exists in agent/scripts/src/
- [ ] If scripts identified in Step 2: each script has tests in agent/scripts/tests/
- [ ] If scripts identified in Step 2: dependencies are in agent/scripts/requirements.txt and installed in .venv
- [ ] .claude/commands/fix.md exists (standard in all workflows)
- [ ] agent/Prompts/00_Workflow_Fixer.md exists (standard in all workflows)
- [ ] agent/Prompts/01_Senior_Prompt_Engineer.md exists (standard in all workflows)
- [ ] If computer use: Computer Use Agent prompt exists?
- [ ] If computer use: Execution commands (execute-workflow, pause, resume) generated?
- [ ] If computer use: computer_use/config.yaml present in generated project?

**Fix any issues found before delivering.**

**Present the final summary:**

```
Workflow "{workflow-name}" is ready!

Location: output/{workflow-name}/

Files created:
├── README.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── agentic.md ({N} steps)
├── .claude/commands/ ({M} commands)
│   ├── {command-1}.md

To use this workflow:
1. Open the project folder in your AI coding agent (e.g., Claude Code, OpenCode)
2. Point it at agentic.md: "Read agentic.md and start"
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions

Patterns applied: {list}
```

---

## After Each Step

**ALWAYS ask for user approval before saving/marking complete:**

1. Show output to the user
2. Ask: "Does this look good? Any changes needed?"
3. **Wait for user approval**
   - If changes requested → Modify and show again
   - If approved → Continue
4. Save files
5. Confirm: "Saved"

**NEVER proceed to the next step without user confirmation.**

## Clarifications

### Self-Similar Architecture
Agent Forge generates workflows that follow the **same architecture** as Agent Forge itself. If you're unsure how to structure something in the generated workflow, look at how Agent Forge does it. The `forge/` directory IS the reference implementation.

### Templates vs From Scratch
**ALWAYS** start from the scaffold templates in `forge/utils/scaffold/`. Never write an `agentic.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, agent prompt, or command file from scratch. The templates exist to enforce consistency. Fill in the placeholders, adapt the structure, but keep the skeleton.

### When to Add Approval Gates
Not every step needs a gate. Add `⏸` only at **decision points** where:
- The user needs to review a design before generation starts (e.g., architecture review)
- Generated content must be approved before building on top of it (e.g., orchestrator review)
- The final deliverable is ready for sign-off

Steps that are purely mechanical (e.g., "generate commands from an already-approved architecture") do NOT need gates.

### When to Add Quality Loops
Only add evaluate-iterate loops when:
- There is a **measurable quality bar** (e.g., "90% of rubric criteria met")
- The output can be objectively improved through iteration
- The user expects iterative refinement as part of the workflow

Do NOT add quality loops to steps where the output is either correct or not (binary).

### Step Count
5-9 steps is the sweet spot. Fewer than 5 usually means steps are too broad and the agent won't know what to focus on. More than 9 usually means steps are too granular and the workflow becomes tedious. If you find yourself designing more than 9, combine related steps.

### Agent Count
Not every step needs a dedicated agent. Agents are for steps that require **specialized expertise** (e.g., "Software Architect" for design, "Code Generator" for implementation). Mechanical steps like "copy a template" or "create folders" don't need agents. The orchestrator handles them directly.

### Generated Workflows Must Be Self-Contained
Every workflow in `output/` must work **without Agent Forge installed**. This means:
- No references to `forge/`, `forge/patterns/`, or `forge/examples/`
- All prompts, commands, and templates are included in the generated project
- A user can copy the output folder anywhere and it works

### The Orchestrator is the Source of Truth
The `agentic.md` file is the **single source of truth** for any workflow. Slash commands are shortcuts that point INTO it, not replacements for it. Agent prompts are read BY it, not independently. Everything flows through the orchestrator.

### Naming Generated Workflows
- Workflow folder: `kebab-case` (e.g., `content-pipeline`)
- Slash commands: `kebab-case` matching step names (e.g., `generate-content.md`)
- Step names: Title Case, human-readable. Describe WHAT the step does ("Generate PDF Report"), never HOW ("Generate PDF report using gen_document.py"). Script filenames belong in the step's workflow details, not in the step title or description.
- Agent prompts: zero-padded with underscores (e.g., `01_Content_Strategist.md`)
- Master command: always named `start-{workflow-name}.md` or `create-{workflow-name}.md`

### What Agent Forge Does NOT Do
- It does **not** generate application code (apps, APIs). It generates **workflow definitions** (orchestrators, prompts, commands) and **utility scripts** that support those workflows (format generators, data processors, API clients, etc.).
- It does **not** execute the workflows it generates. It only creates the files.
- Dependencies and venvs are set up automatically by `generate_scaffold()`. No manual environment setup is needed.

## Quality Checks

| Step | Check |
|------|-------|
| 01 | Description provided? Steps inferred or clarified? Requirements summary confirmed? |
| 02 | Architecture reviewed? Patterns identified? Agents listed? Scripts identified (or "none")? |
| 03 | Orchestrator follows template? All steps present? Gates correct? |
| 04 | All agents generated? Each has all required sections? |
| 05 | One command per step? Master command exists? Fix command exists? Senior prompt engineer copied? Frontmatter complete? |
| 06 | generate_scaffold() called? Scripts from Step 2 placed via add_script()? Venv created? README, CLAUDE.md, agent/ complete? |
| 07 | Self-review passes all checks? Workflow is self-contained? |
| 08 | If computer use: agent prompt, execution commands, and config present? |
