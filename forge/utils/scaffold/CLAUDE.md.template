# {{WORKFLOW_NAME}}

## Project Structure

```
{{STRUCTURE_TREE}}
```
<!-- Complete directory tree showing every file in the project.
     Use standard tree notation (├──, └──, │).
     Include brief comments after filenames for clarity. -->

## How to Use

Start the full workflow:
```
/{{START_COMMAND}}
```

Or run individual steps:
```
{{COMMAND_LIST_WITH_DESCRIPTIONS}}
```
<!-- List each slash command with a comment describing what it does.
     Example: /gather-requirements    # Step 1: Interview the user -->

## Key Rules

{{RULES_LIST}}
<!-- Project-specific rules. Include:
     - What to read before starting (always agentic.md)
     - What NOT to skip (approval gates)
     - Where outputs go
     - What every output must include
     - Any constraints (no external deps, no code execution, etc.) -->

## Naming Conventions

{{NAMING_CONVENTIONS}}
<!-- Document the naming patterns used in this project:
     - Slash commands: kebab-case
     - Agent prompts: numbered with title case
     - Output folders: kebab-case or date-based
     - Placeholders: {{UPPER_SNAKE_CASE}} -->
