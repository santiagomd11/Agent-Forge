## Workflow Overview

```
{{WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM}}
```
<!-- ASCII diagram showing step sequence. Mark approval gates with ⏸ below the step name.
     Keep it to 1-2 lines. Example:

     Step 1         Step 2         Step 3         Step 4
     Gather    -->  Design    -->  Generate  -->  Deliver
                    ⏸                             ⏸
-->

{{FOR_EACH_STEP}}

## Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}: {{STEP_NAME}}
<!-- One step per phase of work. Each step should produce a clear output.
     If a step uses an agent, add a "Read:" directive pointing to its prompt file.
     If the step has an approval gate, add ⏸ to the heading. -->

{{STEP_DESCRIPTION}}

**Read:** `Prompts/{{AGENT_FILE}}` <!-- Only if this step uses a specialized agent. Remove this line for direct/mechanical steps. -->

**Workflow:**

1. {{ACTION_1}}
2. {{ACTION_2}}
3. {{ACTION_N}}
<!-- Numbered list of concrete actions. Each action should be a single, clear instruction.
     Include "Wait for user approval" where gates apply. -->

**Save:** {{OUTPUT_FILES}}
<!-- What files/artifacts this step produces. Be specific: "output/{name}/architecture.md" -->

---

{{END_FOR_EACH_STEP}}

## After Each Step

**ALWAYS ask for user approval before saving/marking complete:**

1. Show output to user
2. Ask: "Does this look good? Any changes needed?"
3. **Wait for user approval**
   - If changes requested → Modify and show again
   - If approved → Continue
4. Save files
5. Confirm: "Saved"

**NEVER proceed to the next step without user confirmation.**

## Output Structure

```
{{OUTPUT_TREE}}
```
<!-- Show the complete folder/file tree that the workflow produces.
     Use standard tree notation (├──, └──, │).
     Include every file and directory the user should expect. -->

---

## Quality Checks

| Step | Check |
|------|-------|
{{QUALITY_CHECKS}}
<!-- One row per step. Each check is a quick verification question.
     Example: "01 | All requirements gathered? Summary approved?" -->
